<p>
This server hosts an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT</a> broker for "internet of things" applications within the <a href="https://chem.wisc.edu">Department of Chemistry</a> at the <a href="https://wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. <br>
</p>

<p>
This server is maintained by Blaise Thompson and the Chemistry Instrument Shop.
Please contact them with any questions or concerns.
This service is "best-effort" and uptime is not guaranteed.
Please design your instrumentation software to be robust in the event of an outage.
Luckily MQTT's core design makes this relatively easy!
</p>

<h2>mosquitto</h2>

<p>
This server runs <a href="https://mosquitto.org/">mosquitto</a>, an MQTT broker.
Briefly, MQTT is a lightweight publish-subscribe protocol that allows many devices to communicate.
The broker provides structured topics, e.g. "sensor42/temperature" and "instrument9/opa2/wavelength".
Clients can publish topic updates.
Other clients can subscribe to be notified each time a topic is updated.
Refer to <a href="https://mqtt.org">mqtt.org</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
Anyone on the campus network can subscribe to the topics served here.
There are lots of great MQTT clients you can use.
We recommend:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_sub-1.html">mosquitto_sub</a> (command line interface)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/eerimoq/mqttools">mqttools</a> (python)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/paho/">paho</a> (many languages)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
To see all topic updates on your command line:
</p>

<pre><code>
mosquitto_sub -h mqtt.chem.wisc.edu -t "#" --verbose

</code></pre>

<p>
You'll need a password to publish to this broker.
Talk to Blaise Thompson to get a password.
</p>

<h2>homie</h2>

<p>
MQTT doesn't have any data recording capabilities built-in.
It's easy to set up your own little recording application, or you can build on top of our infrastructure by using the Homie Convention.
</p>

<p>
We have built tooling around the <a href="https://homieiot.github.io">Homie convention</a>.
Any data published to this server obeying the homie convention will be automatically recorded into our time series database, Graphite.
We also have a Grafana appliance set up to visualize data from Graphite.
